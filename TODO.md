# TODO

## Install and configure

- add my ssh key as a secret
- brightness and redshift
- fix polybar modules (see todos in home-config/polybar.nix)

## Long-term

- find a way to automatically commit the generated dotfiles for non-NixOS users

## Maybe

- manage secrets so that they aren't readable by everyone in store (maybe try
  sops-nix?)
