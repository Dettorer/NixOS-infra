# TODO

## Install and configure

- OBS
- pentablet
- rider
- emacs/tuareg
- add colors to polybar
- add transparency
- add my ssh key as a secret

## Long-term

- find a way to automatically commit the generated dotfiles for non-NixOS users

## Maybe

- manage secrets so that they aren't readable by everyone in store (maybe try
  sops-nix?)
